Reading, storing, and manipulating .ppm files using arrays.

The Image class is designed to read information from a .ppm file and store it in an array.
The Image class also contains a number of methods that demonstrate how .ppm files can be 
manipulated using arrays.

The executable, imageDriver removes all of the blue color from a specified .ppm file. It
does this by reading the file into an Image object and setting the blue value of all 
pixels to zero. You can call the executable with a .ppm file name as an argument:
 
    ./imageDriver img.ppm

You can save the output of imageDriver as a new .ppm file by piping the output 
to a new file:
   
    ./imageDriver img.ppm > newimg.ppm

This executable will run on on both Mac and Linux machines, but will require a way to 
convert and display .ppm images. The program does not properly run when compiled on a 
Windows machine as of now.
