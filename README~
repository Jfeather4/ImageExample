Reading, storing, and manipulating .ppm files using arrays.

The Image class is designed to read information from a .ppm file and store it in an array.
The Image class also contains a number of methods that demonstrate how .ppm files can be 
manipulated using arrays.

The executable, imageDriver removes all of the blue color from the file "newpic.ppm." It
does this by reading newpic.ppm into an Image object and setting the blue value of all 
pixels to zero. You can save the output of imageDriver as a new image by piping the output 
to a new file:
   
    ./imageDriver > newimg.ppm

This executable will run on on both Mac and Linux machines, but will require a way to 
convert and display .ppm images. To compile and run on Windows, you will probably need 
minGW or some equivalent program.
